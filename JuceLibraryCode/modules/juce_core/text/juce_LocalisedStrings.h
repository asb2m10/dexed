/**
    Used to convert strings to localised foreign-language versions.

    This is basically a look-up table of strings and their translated equivalents.
    It can be loaded from a text file, so that you can supply a set of localised
    versions of strings that you use in your app.

    To use it in your code, simply call the translate() method on each string that
    might have foreign versions, and if none is found, the method will just return
    the original string.

    The translation file should start with some lines specifying a description of
    the language it contains, and also a list of ISO country codes where it might
    be appropriate to use the file. After that, each line of the file should contain
    a pair of quoted strings with an '=' sign.

    E.g. for a french translation, the file might be:

    @code
    language: French
    countries: fr be mc ch lu

    "hello" = "bonjour"
    "goodbye" = "au revoir"
    @endcode

    If the strings need to contain a quote character, they can use '\"' instead, and
    if the first non-whitespace character on a line isn't a quote, then it's ignored,
    (you can use this to add comments).

    Note that this is a singleton class, so don't create or destroy the object directly.
    There's also a TRANS(text) macro defined to make it easy to use the this.

    E.g. @code
    printSomething (TRANS("hello"));
    @endcode

    This macro is used in the JUCE classes themselves, so your application has a chance to
    intercept and translate any internal JUCE text strings that might be shown. (You can easily
    get a list of all the messages by searching for the TRANS() macro in the JUCE source
    code).
