    A simple implementation of a Logger that writes to a file.

        @param fileToWriteTo    the file that to use - new messages will be appended
                                to the file. If the file doesn't exist, it will be created,
                                along with any parent directories that are needed.
        @param welcomeMessage   when opened, the logger will write a header to the log, along
                                with the current date and time, and this welcome message
        @param maxInitialFileSizeBytes  if this is zero or greater, then if the file already exists
                                but is larger than this number of bytes, then the start of the
                                file will be truncated to keep the size down. This prevents a log
                                file getting ridiculously large over time. The file will be truncated
                                at a new-line boundary. If this value is less than zero, no size limit
                                will be imposed; if it's zero, the file will always be deleted. Note that
                                the size is only checked once when this object is created - any logging
                                that is done later will be appended without any checking
