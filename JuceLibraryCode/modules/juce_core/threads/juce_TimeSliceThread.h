        quick - never block for longer than absolutely necessary.

                    again. Returning 0 will make the thread call again as soon as possible (after possibly servicing
                    other busy clients). If you return a value below zero, your client will be removed from the list of clients,
                    and won't be called again. The value you specify isn't a guarantee, and is only used as a hint by the
                    thread - the actual time before the next callback may be more or less than specified.
                    You can force the TimeSliceThread to wake up and poll again immediately by calling its notify() method.
