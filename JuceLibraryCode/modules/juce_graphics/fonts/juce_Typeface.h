/**
    A typeface represents a size-independent font.

    This base class is abstract, but calling createSystemTypefaceFor() will return
    a platform-specific subclass that can be used.

    The CustomTypeface subclass allow you to build your own typeface, and to
    load and save it in the JUCE typeface format.

    Normally you should never need to deal directly with Typeface objects - the Font
    class does everything you typically need for rendering text.
