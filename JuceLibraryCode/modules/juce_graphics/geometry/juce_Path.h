/**
    A path is a sequence of lines and curves that may either form a closed shape
    or be open-ended.

    To use a path, you can create an empty one, then add lines and curves to it
    to create shapes, then it can be rendered by a Graphics context or used
    for geometric operations.

    e.g. @code
    Path myPath;

    myPath.startNewSubPath (10.0f, 10.0f);          // move the current position to (10, 10)
    myPath.lineTo (100.0f, 200.0f);                 // draw a line from here to (100, 200)
    myPath.quadraticTo (0.0f, 150.0f, 5.0f, 50.0f); // draw a curve that ends at (5, 50)
    myPath.closeSubPath();                          // close the subpath with a line back to (10, 10)

    // add an ellipse as well, which will form a second sub-path within the path..
    myPath.addEllipse (50.0f, 50.0f, 40.0f, 30.0f);

    // double the width of the whole thing..
    myPath.applyTransform (AffineTransform::scale (2.0f, 1.0f));

    // and draw it to a graphics context with a 5-pixel thick outline.
    g.strokePath (myPath, PathStrokeType (5.0f));

    @endcode

    A path object can actually contain multiple sub-paths, which may themselves
    be open or closed.
