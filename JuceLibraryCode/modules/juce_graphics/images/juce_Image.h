    Holds a fixed-size bitmap.

    The image is stored in either 24-bit RGB or 32-bit premultiplied-ARGB format.

    To draw into an image, create a Graphics object for it.
    e.g. @code

    // create a transparent 500x500 image..
    Image myImage (Image::RGB, 500, 500, true);

    Graphics g (myImage);
    g.setColour (Colours::red);
    g.fillEllipse (20, 20, 300, 200);  // draws a red ellipse in our image.
    @endcode

    Other useful ways to create an image are with the ImageCache class, or the
    ImageFileFormat, which provides a way to load common image files.
