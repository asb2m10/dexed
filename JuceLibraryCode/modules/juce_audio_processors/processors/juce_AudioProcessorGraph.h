/**
    A type of AudioProcessor which plays back a graph of other AudioProcessors.

    Use one of these objects if you want to wire-up a set of AudioProcessors
    and play back the result.

    Processors can be added to the graph as "nodes" using addNode(), and once
    added, you can connect any of their input or output channels to other
    nodes using addConnection().

    To play back a graph through an audio device, you might want to use an
    AudioProcessorPlayer object.
