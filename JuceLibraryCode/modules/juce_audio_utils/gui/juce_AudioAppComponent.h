/**
    A base class for writing audio apps that stream from the audio i/o devices.
    Conveniently combines a Component with an AudioSource to provide a starting
    point for your audio applications.

    A subclass can inherit from this and implement just a few methods such as
    getNextAudioBlock(). The base class provides a basic AudioDeviceManager object
    and runs audio through the default output device.

    An application should only create one global instance of this object and multiple
    classes should not inherit from this.

    This class should not be inherited when creating a plug-in as the host will
    handle audio streams from hardware devices.

        An AudioSource has two states: prepared and unprepared.

        The prepareToPlay() method is guaranteed to be called at least once on an 'unprepared'
        source to put it into a 'prepared' state before any calls will be made to getNextAudioBlock().
        This callback allows the source to initialise any resources it might need when playing.

        Once playback has finished, the releaseResources() method is called to put the stream
        back into an 'unprepared' state.

        Note that this method could be called more than once in succession without
        a matching call to releaseResources(), so make sure your code is robust and
        can handle that kind of situation.

                                        getNextAudioBlock() method is called. This
                                        number may vary slightly, because it will be dependent
                                        on audio hardware callbacks, and these aren't
                                        guaranteed to always use a constant block size, so
                                        the source should be able to cope with small variations.
        @param sampleRate               the sample rate that the output will be used at - this
                                        is needed by sources such as tone generators.

        method called, so it should release any spare memory, etc. that it might have
        allocated during the prepareToPlay() call.

        Note that there's no guarantee that prepareToPlay() will actually have been called before
        releaseResources(), and it may be called more than once in succession, so make sure your
        code is robust and doesn't make any assumptions about when it will be called.

        time the audio playback hardware (or whatever other destination the audio
        data is going to) needs another block of data.

        It will generally be called on a high-priority system thread, or possibly even
        an interrupt, so be careful not to do too much work here, as that will cause
