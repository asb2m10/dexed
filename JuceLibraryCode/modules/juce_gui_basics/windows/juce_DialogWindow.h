/**
    A dialog-box style window.

    This class is a convenient way of creating a DocumentWindow with a close button
    that can be triggered by pressing the escape key.

    Any of the methods available to a DocumentWindow or ResizableWindow are also
    available to this, so it can be made resizable, have a menu bar, etc.

    You can either override or use an instance of the DialogWindow class directly,
    or you can use a DialogWindow::LaunchOptions structure to quickly set up and
    launch a box containing a content component.

    If you use the class directly, you'll need to override the
    DocumentWindow::closeButtonPressed() method to handle the user clicking the close
    button - for more info, see the DocumentWindow help.

                                    be deleted by this call, so you can re-use it or delete
                                    it afterwards
