/**
    This class represents an instrument handling MPE.

    It has an MPE zone layout and maintains a state of currently
    active (playing) notes and the values of their dimensions of expression.

    You can trigger and modulate notes:
      - by passing MIDI messages with the method processNextMidiEvent;
      - by directly calling the methods noteOn, noteOff etc.

    The class implements the channel and note management logic specified in
    MPE. If you pass it a message, it will know what notes on what
    channels (if any) should be affected by that message.

    The class has a Listener class with the three callbacks MPENoteAdded,
    MPENoteChanged, and MPENoteFinished. Implement such a
    Listener class to react to note changes and trigger some functionality for
    your application that depends on the MPE note state.
    For example, you can use this class to write an MPE visualiser.

    If you want to write a real-time audio synth with MPE functionality,
    you should instead use the classes MPESynthesiserBase, which adds
    the ability to render audio and to manage voices.
