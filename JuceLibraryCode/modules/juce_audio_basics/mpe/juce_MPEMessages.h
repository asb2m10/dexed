/**
    This helper class contains the necessary helper functions to generate
    MIDI messages that are exclusive to MPE, such as defining the upper and lower
    MPE zones and setting per-note and master pitchbend ranges.
    You can then send them to your MPE device using MidiOutput::sendBlockOfMessagesNow.

    All other MPE messages like per-note pitchbend, pressure, and third
    dimension, are ordinary MIDI messages that should be created using the MidiMessage
    class instead. You just need to take care to send them to the appropriate
    per-note MIDI channel.

    Note: If you are working with an MPEZoneLayout object inside your app,
    you should not use the message sequences provided here. Instead, you should
    change the zone layout programmatically with the member functions provided in the
    MPEZoneLayout class itself. You should also make sure that the Expressive
    MIDI zone layout of your C++ code and of the MPE device are kept in sync.
