/**
    Base class for an MPE-compatible musical device that can play sounds.

    This class extends MPESynthesiserBase by adding the concept of voices,
    each of which can play a sound triggered by a MPENote that can be modulated
    by MPE dimensions like pressure, pitchbend, and timbre, while the note is
    sounding.

    To create a synthesiser, you'll need to create a subclass of MPESynthesiserVoice
    which can play back one of these sounds at a time.

    Then you can use the addVoice() methods to give the synthesiser a set of voices
    it can use to play notes. If you only give it one voice it will be monophonic -
    the more voices it has, the more polyphony it'll have available.

    Then repeatedly call the renderNextBlock() method to produce the audio (inherited
    from MPESynthesiserBase). The voices will be started, stopped, and modulated
    automatically, based on the MPE/MIDI messages that the synthesiser receives.

    Before rendering, be sure to call the setCurrentPlaybackSampleRate() to tell it
    what the target playback rate is. This value is passed on to the voices so that
    they can pitch their output correctly.
