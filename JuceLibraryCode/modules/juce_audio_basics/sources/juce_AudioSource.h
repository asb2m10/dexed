    Base class for objects that can produce a continuous stream of audio.

    An AudioSource has two states: 'prepared' and 'unprepared'.

    When a source needs to be played, it is first put into a 'prepared' state by a call to
    prepareToPlay(), and then repeated calls will be made to its getNextAudioBlock() method to
    process the audio data.

    Once playback has finished, the releaseResources() method is called to put the stream
    back into an 'unprepared' state.

        An AudioSource has two states: prepared and unprepared.

        The prepareToPlay() method is guaranteed to be called at least once on an 'unprepared'
        source to put it into a 'prepared' state before any calls will be made to getNextAudioBlock().
        This callback allows the source to initialise any resources it might need when playing.

        Once playback has finished, the releaseResources() method is called to put the stream
        back into an 'unprepared' state.

        Note that this method could be called more than once in succession without
        a matching call to releaseResources(), so make sure your code is robust and
        can handle that kind of situation.

                                        number may vary slightly, because it will be dependent
                                        on audio hardware callbacks, and these aren't
                                        guaranteed to always use a constant block size, so

                                        is needed by sources such as tone generators.
