Dexed - FM Plugin Synth (Mod)
=======================
Mod Changelog:

* Simplified cmake build
* Cleaned unused resources
* LV2 support (Add "LV2" to `FORMATS` in CMakelists.txt to build)
--------------------------

Please see [Dexed User Website](https://asb2m10.github.io/dexed) for user and download information.

Dexed is a multi platform, multi format plugin synth that is closely modeled on the Yamaha DX7. 
Under the hood it uses [music-synthesizer-for-android](https://github.com/google/music-synthesizer-for-android) 
for the synth engine and [JUCE](https://www.juce.com) as an application/plugin wrapper.

The goal of this project is to be a tool/companion for the original DX7. Sound engine 
with 'float' value parameters, different waveform Ã  la TX81z would be great but anything that 
goes beyond the DX7 should and will be a fork of this project. This is to keep the compatibility with
the original machine.

Dexed is licensed on the GPL v3. The msfa component (acronym for music synthesizer for android, see msfa 
in the source folder) stays on the Apache 2.0 license to able to collaborate between projects.

# How to build

Clone Dexed from github

```
~ $ git clone https://github.com/asb2m10/dexed.git
```

Dexed has several submodules it now depends on, including VST3/CLAP and a library to support non standard tuning. After you clone your first step is

```
~ $ cd dexed
~/dexed $ git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Then you crate the cmake build files that are will be created in the build directory. On that build you can trigger your favorite IDE or simply use `--build` cmake option.

```
~/dexed $ mkdir build
~/dexed $ cd build
~/dexed/build $ cmake .. -DJUCE_COPY_PLUGIN_AFTER_BUILD=TRUE
~/dexed/build $ cmake --build .
```

If you get missing header compilation errors, be sure to check the [known Linux dependencies](https://github.com/asb2m10/dexed/wiki/Linux-builds-dependencies) based on your distribution for Linux.

Binaries will be found in `~/dexed/build/Source/Dexed_artefacts/*`
