Dexed - FM Plugin Synth
=======================


Please see [Dexed User Website](https://asb2m10.github.io/dexed) for user and download information.

Dexed is a multi platform, multi format plugin synth that is closely modeled on the Yamaha DX7. 
Under the hood it uses [music-synthesizer-for-android](https://github.com/google/music-synthesizer-for-android) 
for the synth engine and [JUCE](https://www.juce.com) as an application/plugin wrapper.

The goal of this project is to be a tool/companion for the original DX7. Sound engine 
with 'float' value parameters, different waveform Ã  la TX81z would be great but anything that 
goes beyond the DX7 should and will be a fork of this project. This is to keep the compatibility with
the original machine.

Dexed is licensed on the GPL v3. The msfa component (acronym for music synthesizer for android, see msfa 
in the source folder) stays on the Apache 2.0 license to able to collaborate between projects.

# How to build DEXED

You will notice that DEXED no longer ships with built makefiles. Rather it has a collection of scripts to 
get a version of JUCE and build them for you. With juce6 this will change even more, but for now to build you
will want to get and run juce and the projucer yourself. Luckily this is fairly easy

## All OSes

DEXED has several submodules it now depends on, including VST3 and a library to support non standard tuning.
After you clone your first step is

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

which will expand the submodules. Then follow platform specific directions below

## macOS

```
./scripts/get-juce.sh
./scripts/projuce-mac.sh
./scripts/build-mac.sh
```

This will build a VST3, and AU and a Standalone in Build/MacOSX/Release for your

## windows
Run this in the bash shell that comes with the standard Git distribution.

```
./scripts/get-juce.sh
./assets/JUCE/Projucer.exe --resave dexed.jucer
```

then open and build the resulting Visual Studio Solution file.

## Linux

```
./scripts/get-juce.sh
./scripts/projuce-lin.sh
./scripts/build-lin.sh
```
### Compilation errors - missing header files
If you get missing header compilation errors you can just look up the names of the missing header files on debian.packages.org, which will give you a list of packages that include that header.
You may have to install packages like:
```
sudo apt install libx11-dev
sudo apt install libcurl4-gnutls-dev
sudo apt install libfreetype6-dev
sudo apt install libasound2-dev
sudo apt install libxinerama-dev
sudo apt install libjack-jackd2-dev
sudo apt install libxcursor-dev
sudo apt install libxrandr-dev
```

### VST2 Support
Since Steinberg has discontinued the VST2 API we no longer distribute a VST2.

If you are a licensee to the VST2SDK, though, you can build a VST2 version of DEXED yourself with these commands

```
./scripts/get-juce.sh
export VST2SDK_DIR=~/path/to/vst2/sdk/dir
./scripts/projuce-lin-vst2.sh
./scripts/build-lin.sh
```
